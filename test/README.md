# Unit tests
These tests are designed to run without a spack instance. They do not test spack. They do not test packages. They only test package descriptions or other stand-alone components.

# Integration tests
These tests are designed to test if spack-c2sm integrates with spack. They do not test packages.

# System tests
These tests are designed to test the collaboration of spack-c2sm, spack and the packages.
