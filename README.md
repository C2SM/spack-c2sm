# The C2SM Spack Deployment
Spack is the package manager used by C2SM and MeteoSwiss to install 
and deploy our software on supercomputers 
mostly at the Swiss Super Computing Center (CSCS)

## Quickly build your local cosmo with spack:

* **Tsa**

```bash
module load python/3.7.4
source /project/g110/spack/user/tsa/spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh # Source spack instance
spack info cosmo # Check available options 
spack spec cosmo # Check if your spec is precised enough, else precise more options
cd <cosmo_base_dir> # cosmo, not cosmo/cosmo
spack devbuildcosmo cosmo@dev-build # -t option for test, -c for clean build usually cosmo@dev-build%pgi is enough

```
* **Daint**

```bash
module load cray-python
source /project/g110/spack/user/daint/spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh # Source spack instance
spack info cosmo # Check available options 
spack spec cosmo # Check if your spec is precised enough, else precise more options
cd <cosmo_base_dir> # cosmo, not cosmo/cosmo
spack devbuildcosmo cosmo@dev-build # -t option for test, -c for clean build usually cosmo@dev-build%pgi is enough

```

## Automatically source the correct spack instance & python3 when using bash

If you want to automatically source the correct spack instance depending on the machine you are working on, you can add the following lines to your .bashrc file:

```bash
case $(hostname -s) in
      tsa*|arolla*) module load python; export SPACK_ROOT=/project/g110/spack/user/tsa/spack ;;
      daint*) module load cray-python; export SPACK_ROOT=/project/g110/spack/user/daint/spack ;;
esac
source $SPACK_ROOT/share/spack/setup-env.sh
```
