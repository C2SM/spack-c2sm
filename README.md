[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/ansicolortags/badge/?version=latest)](https://C2SM.github.io/spack-c2sm/latest)

Spack is the package manager used by C2SM and MeteoSwiss to install and deploy software on supercomputers, local machines and the cloud.

## Workflow
We suggest local/individual spack instances and the use of spack environments.

Clone the repository
```bash
git clone --depth 1 --recurse-submodules --shallow-submodules -b v0.21.1.3 https://github.com/C2SM/spack-c2sm.git
```
Setup the shell environment and optionally specify an upstream, where spack will look for installed software, i.e.
```bash
. spack-c2sm/setup-env.sh
. spack-c2sm/setup-env.sh /user-environment
. spack-c2sm/setup-env.sh /mch-environment/v6
. spack-c2sm/setup-env.sh /mch-environment/v7
```
Sourcing this file will put the spack command in your PATH, set up your MODULEPATH to use Spackâ€™s packages, and add other useful shell integration for certain commands, environments, and modules. For bash, it also sets up tab completion. (source: [spack docu](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/v0.21.1/getting_started.html#shell-support))

Optionally activate a spack environment
```bash
spack env activate <path_to_env>
```
and starts exploring
```bash
spack info <package>
spack spec <spec>
```
and installing
```bash
spack install <spec>
spack dev-build <spec>
```
packages.

Updating spack-c2sm is in the hands of the user.
```bash
git pull
git submodule update --recursive
```
Before an update we advice to clean your instance
```bash
spack uninstall -a
spack clean -a
rm -rf ~/.spack
```
After an update we advice to rebuild packages, preferably in a new shell so that no outdated shell variables are retained.

[**Spec syntax**](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/v0.18.1/basic_usage.html#specs-dependencies): `<package>`[`@<version>`](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/v0.18.1/basic_usage.html#version-specifier)[`%<compiler>`](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/v0.18.1/basic_usage.html#compiler-specifier)[`+<variant> ~<variant>`](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/v0.18.1/basic_usage.html#variants)[`^<sub-package> +<sub-package-variant>`](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/v0.18.1/basic_usage.html#specs-dependencies)[`<compiler flags>`](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/v0.18.1/basic_usage.html#compiler-flags)

|  | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Find | `spack find` lists all installed packages. <br>`spack find <spec>` lists all installed packages that match the spec.
| Info | `spack info <package>` |
| Spec | `spack spec <spec>` concretizes abstract spec (unspecfied variant = **any**)<br>*Spack is not required to use the default of an unspecified variant. The default value is only a tiebreaker for the concretizer.* |
